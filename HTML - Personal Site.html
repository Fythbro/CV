     <p>Hi,my name is <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WalrusPaladin">Fynn Thompson.</a></strong> Over the past 9 years i have been developing a career in Facilities Management and Client side commercial real estate, but recently felt I like a change.</p>
     <p>While I have been pursuing a career in real estate, to which end I obtained an RICS accredited degree in 2020, it has become apparent that getting onto the RICS pathway is out of reach for me now.</p>
     <p>As a consequence, i have decided to look into web/software development. While I have always been on the periphery of the subject (being a dab hand at excel, and studying logic as part of my Philosophy degree)</p>
     <p>I never had the courage to take the plunge and try my hand at it; that changed in Feb 2023 after a few conversations with close friends and a frank assessment of my earning potential in my current career.</p>
     <p>While I'm unsure of where this path will end up, i relish the challenge ahead!</p>
